# Exploring Predictive Models for Concrete Compressive Strength

This project aims to predict concrete compressive strength using various machine learning approaches. It involves a comparative analysis of different models to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Overview

The project explores the following machine learning models:

- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis) with Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Random Forest Regression**

Each model is implemented and analyzed to understand its predictive performance in predicting concrete compressive strength.

## Key Features

- **Model Implementation:** Detailed implementation of each machine learning model using Python.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluation of model performance, advantages, and disadvantages.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations such as graphs and charts to illustrate results.
